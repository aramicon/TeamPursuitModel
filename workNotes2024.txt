- list of tests to run

- 1, no improvement. example of resulting strategy 
- 2 selection that is NOT based on fitness, purely random.


-- add an overall switch for turning mutations fully off. want to test with no mutations but not set each one to 0.

- "ga_mutation_switch":0,

-- ok, ahd to add more code than hoped for, but now mutate_race() returns a clone of the original, with some stats settings added

	"ga_p_crossover": 0.3, - set this to 0, should then have NO crossover of mutation, but still have fitness based selection, so clones of the best strategy will spread?

- next step wou;d be to have random selection instead of fitness-based
