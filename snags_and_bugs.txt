snag notes

bug: 16/07 race breaks for these settings.

instructions: [[137,"drop=3"],[144,"effort=6.16"],[155,"drop=2"],[200,"drop=1"],[260,"drop=3"],[357,"effort=4.33"],[372,"effort=6.37"],[376,"effort=1.22"]]
start order: 1, 2, 0, 3

behaviour: order of riders changes and last rider gets velocity < 0. mad.


BUG 18/7

If I have one mad strong sprinter, e.g. max watts 2000, and put it at the front and set the effort to anything over 6, e.g. [[2,"effort=6.002"]], it immediately drops the other riders: so there is some problem with how it maps effort to watts!

-- looked at this for the vis model only

BUG 30/07

very different finish times in some cases.

[[24,"effort=7.61"],[95,"drop=3"],[128,"drop=2"],[154,"drop=1"],[213,"drop=3"]] with 0,3,1,2

-- it seems like there is a tiny change in accumulated fatigue, which in the VIS version is higher and forces a rider to go into recovery where the NOVIS does not. It seems that when a rider drops back in the VIS it accumulates fatigue on that step, whereas the NON-VIS does not.
-- yup, fatigue for following riders in the NOVIS version was applied before the final power had been calced. It based fatigue on the target power. Mistake!
